[{"content":"Introduction\rWe strive to be pious men! Pious has taken on an image of hypocrisy and holy-than-thou attitude since it was originally coined but I mean it in the traditional sense! Pious: Faithful, Living one\u0026rsquo;s convictions, Honoring one\u0026rsquo;s duties. What more could we desire to be?! Piety encompasses courage, for it is the epitome of courage to remain faithful in the face of doubt, derision, and despair! Piety includes strength for just as one must be courages to remain faithful, one must be strong in order to live out their convictions, if your convictions do not demand strength of you then they are weak, worthless, and wilted! Piety requires love for to honor one\u0026rsquo;s duties in spite of the pain and suffering that may come from such a task requires that you love something, whether that be your dog, your daughter, your duty, or your diety!\nPiety is one of the core pillars of masculinity! Not just faith, but piety, even in modern dictionaries it is often described as something outward. The modern description ignores the inward piety, but still reflects that piety is more than just faith in something! It is to act upon that faith! To believe in something so completely that it changes who you are and how you live every day! I strive to be more pious. To my God, to my family, to my friends, and to my countrymen! I will write here whatever I can find that will bolster that! But I will also write about a great many other things I\u0026rsquo;m sure! Lots of topics that I become infatuated with just need to be written down for later! And I hope that perhaps you all can benefit somewhat from my ramblings!\nGod bless, stay in the way!\nJohn 14:6 Jesus said to him, â€œI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\u0026quot;\n","date":"2025-06-24T18:37:42-07:00","permalink":"https://pious.men/posts/pious-men/","title":"Pious Men"}]
